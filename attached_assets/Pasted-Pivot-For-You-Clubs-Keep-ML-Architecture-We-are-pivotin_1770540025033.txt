Pivot “For You” → “Clubs” (Keep ML + Architecture)

We are pivoting the existing “For You” tab into a “Clubs” tab while preserving the entire backend architecture, ML engine, embeddings, and hybrid scoring system.

The backend ML pipeline we already built (embeddings, hybrid scoring, collaborative filtering, urgency scoring) must remain intact and be reused for club discovery and ranking.

Do NOT rebuild the app and do NOT change other tabs unless explicitly stated.

Events tab must remain general city/community events and offers.

The change is limited to the For You tab behavior, labeling, filters, and data interpretation.

1. Rename “For You” → “Clubs”

Frontend changes only:

Rename the tab label, page title, and any references from:
For You → Clubs

Do not change routing structure or component layout.

Keep the TikTok-style full-screen card UI exactly the same.

2. Replace Entertainment Domains with Campus Club Domains

Remove domains:
movies, music, games, food, hobbies

Replace with:
academic
professional
social
sports
volunteering

These should appear as selectable filters at the top.

Allow:
• selecting multiple domains at once
• selecting none = show all

If multiple domains are selected, combine results.

3. Add Sorting Mode (Match vs Urgency)

Add a simple toggle UI:

Recommended (default) → sorted by ML match score
Upcoming → sorted by urgencyScore

Do not redesign UI — reuse existing filter/toggle patterns.

Backend already supports:
matchScore
urgencyScore

Just pass:
GET /api/recommendations/:domain?sort=match
GET /api/recommendations/:domain?sort=urgency

4. Club Cards (Reuse Existing Card Layout)

Each full-screen card must display:

Club Name
Description
Category badge
Next meeting date
Location
Dues deadline (if exists)
Signup link
Instagram link
Mutual friends attending (avatars or count)

Hide fields gracefully if missing.

Do not redesign typography or card layout.

5. Backend Integration (Reuse ML Engine)

Important:
We are NOT rewriting the backend ML engine.

The existing system must continue to be used:

Embeddings → semantic similarity between users and clubs
Collaborative filtering → "students like you joined this club"
Trait explanations → human-readable reasoning
Urgency scoring → deadlines and upcoming meetings
Social matching → mutuals and co-attendance

Clubs must be treated as “items” in the same embedding and scoring pipeline.

Ensure /api/recommendations/:domain returns these fields if missing:

nextMeetingAt
locationDetails
signupUrl
instagramUrl
duesDeadline
mutualsInClubCount
mutualsInClubPreview
urgencyScore
urgencyLabel

Do NOT remove existing fields:
matchScore
explanation
scoringMethod
vectorScore
cfScore

6. Seed Realistic TAMU-Style Clubs (Placeholder Data)

Update seed data to include realistic examples such as:

Aggie Coding Club
Next meeting: Sept 12
Location: Zachry Engineering Building
Dues deadline: Sept 20
Mutuals: Colin, Andy

Texas A&M Cybersecurity Club
Workshops + CTF prep
Location: HRBB
Meeting every Thursday

Aggie Robotics
Project teams + competitions
Location: ETB

Women in Engineering
Networking + mentorship

Aggie Outdoors
Camping trips + climbing

Make realistic descriptions and meeting schedules.

This improves demo credibility.

7. Events Tab Must Stay Separate

Events tab should remain:

City events
Restaurant deals
Local concerts
Community events
Pop-up activities

Do NOT merge Clubs into Events.

Clubs = recruitment + meetings
Events = social + city happenings

8. Maintain ML + Interdisciplinary Angle

Do NOT remove:

embedding engine
hybrid scoring
collaborative filtering
geospatial ranking
explainability layer

Clubs should simply become a new domain in the same system.

This preserves:
AI/ML
social computing
behavior modeling
recommendation systems

9. Final Validation

After implementation:

Run demo/reset
Open Clubs tab
Verify:
No movies/music appear
Only clubs show
Match sorting works
Urgency sorting works
Events tab unchanged

Optional but Recommended

Add a small badge on club cards:
“Recommended by AI based on your interests”

This strengthens demo clarity.
