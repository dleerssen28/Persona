Prompt 1 — Data Model Pivot (Non-breaking)

Goal: Keep current tables/routes working, but add club-specific fields and seed club data in the existing items and events tables.

Send to Replit:
We are pivoting from movies/music/games/food/hobbies to a campus product: Clubs + Club events + deadlines + mutuals going. Do this WITHOUT breaking frontend or API routes. Keep existing tables and endpoints, but change seeded content + fields.

Backend changes:

Keep using items table for “clubs” (domain stays but will map to club categories).

Update seeding so items.domain uses: academic, professional, social, sports, volunteering (5 domains).

Each item is now a club with:

title = club name

description = club synopsis (2–3 lines)

tags = [career_alignment, vibe, commitment, skills, industry]

imageUrl = existing frontend image string format (use current image identifiers)

Keep using events table for:

category="custom": student-created club hangouts / watch parties / meetings

category="organized": official club meetings / recruiting nights / info sessions (also campus-wide deals if needed)
Add non-breaking new columns to events (nullable):

clubId (references items.id) OR clubName (text) if you want simple

signupDeadline timestamp nullable

duesDeadline timestamp nullable

cost text nullable (e.g. “$20 dues”, “free”)

rsvpLimit integer nullable

locationDetails text nullable (e.g. “MSC Room 2400”)

Keep embeddings working:

Use existing embedding generation for items/events: embed title + description + tags + major/year targeting text + commitment text.

Update seed.ts:

Replace movie/music/game/food items with ~40–60 TAMU-like clubs across the domains above (engineering orgs, consulting clubs, cultural orgs, service orgs, sports, etc.)

Replace events with club recruiting events + first meetings + dues deadlines + “tonight” events.

Ensure at least 8–12 events are within the next 14 days.

After seeding, ensure POST /api/demo/reset still produces a deterministic demo state.

Do NOT change any frontend code yet. Ensure existing recommendation/event endpoints still return expected fields.

Prompt 2 — Clubs “For You” (Same endpoint, new meaning)

Goal: /api/recommendations/:domain becomes “clubs recommended” but the route stays.

Send to Replit:
Update the recommendation meaning without breaking frontend:

GET /api/recommendations/:domain should now return club recommendations (from items table) for the given domain (academic/professional/social/sports/volunteering).

Keep response shape EXACTLY as current frontend expects (including matchScore, explanation, scoringMethod, vectorScore, cfScore if present).

Update the explanation generator to be club-specific:

“Matches your career direction (systems/cyber/AI)”

“Fits your social energy + commitment style”

“Aligns with your hands-on / competitive / collaborative preferences”

Collaborative filtering should now be: “students like you saved/joined this club”

Use interactions on items in these domains.

No UI changes. Just make the same endpoint feed club cards.

Prompt 3 — Add Urgency Scoring without breaking UI

Goal: Keep the UI the same, but allow the backend to return urgency fields so the frontend can later display them.

Send to Replit:
Add urgency/deadline intelligence to clubs and events without breaking anything:

Add a server-side urgencyScore for:

clubs: based on nearest related event’s signupDeadline/duesDeadline/firstMeeting

events: based on time until event + deadline proximity

Include in API responses (non-breaking new fields):

For recommended clubs (/api/recommendations/:domain):

nextMeetingAt, signupDeadline, duesDeadline, urgencyScore (0–100), urgencyLabel (“Due soon”, “This week”, “No deadline”)

For events (/api/events and /api/events/for-you):

urgencyScore, timeToStartHours, deadlineInHours

Do not remove any existing fields. Frontend can ignore these for now.

Prompt 4 — Mutual friends going (core feature)

Goal: Events page becomes powerful: show mutuals going, not just attendee count.

Send to Replit:
Implement mutual friends going + “you should meet” logic, using existing RSVP data and social graph:

For GET /api/events and GET /api/events/for-you, include:

attendeePreview: up to 8 attendees (name, avatar)

mutualsGoing: attendees who are in the requester’s top friend matches OR have matchScore >= 75 with requester

mutualsGoingCount

Add field whyThisEvent (string) that picks 1–2 reasons:

“3 of your high-match people are going”

“Strong match + starts soon”

“Fits your career alignment”

Ensure this works in demo/reset with seeded users RSVPed to realistic events (not all events).

No frontend changes.
