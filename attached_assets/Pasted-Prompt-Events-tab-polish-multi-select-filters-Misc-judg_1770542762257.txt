Prompt: Events tab polish (multi-select filters + Misc + judge hover AI explanations + smarter “why” line)

Goal: Improve the existing Events tab only. Do NOT touch Clubs tab behavior (it’s perfect). Do NOT change the overall layout (keep TikTok scroller cards). Only refine Events UI + the data returned for Events so the AI/ML is obvious to judges and the copy is context-aware.

A) Multi-select top filter chips (like Clubs)

Currently Events top bar chips are single-select. Change to multi-select.

Chips should allow multiple active at once (toggle on/off).

Include these chips (keep current ones, but ensure all exist):

For You

Deals

Campus

Parties

Study

Shows

Misc (NEW)

Rules:

If no chips selected, treat as For You default behavior.

If multiple chips selected, show events matching any selected category (OR logic), then sort by ranking.

Visually, selected chips should match the current selected styling used in Clubs.

B) Add “Misc” category + placeholder events

Add a new event category “misc” (or “Misc”) end-to-end:

Update seed data to include at least 6 Misc events:

Pumpkin patch / fall festival

Farmers market

Outdoor thrift pop-up

Movie in the park

Charity 5K

Art walk / gallery night
Make them realistic for a college town, include date/time, location, tags, and a decent description. Include at least 1 that’s urgent today.

C) Ranking logic for Events (keep AI/ML visible)

Events should be ranked by a hybrid score that uses the ML you built (local embeddings) plus social proof and urgency.

Use this score (or extremely close):

tasteScore (ML): embedding similarity userTasteEmbedding ↔ eventEmbedding (existing)

socialScore: based on friend/mutual attendance signals

e.g., count of “friends going” + “mutuals going” (or “compatible attendees going” if you don’t have explicit friend graph)

urgencyScore: if event ends today / deadline today / within 24h / this week

Final ranking suggestion:
finalScore = 0.55*tasteScore + 0.25*socialScore + 0.20*urgencyScore

Also:

Deals chip should boost urgency weight (because deals expiring matter more).

Study chip should boost persona academic alignment weight slightly (see section E).

D) Hover explanation on the “% match” badge (judge-facing)

When the user hovers over the match badge (e.g., “60% match”), show a small tooltip/popover explaining exactly what math/AI is happening.

Tooltip content requirements (3–6 lines, human-readable, judge-friendly):

“This score is computed using ML text embeddings (MiniLM) + vector similarity.”

“We compare your Taste DNA embedding to the event embedding (cosine similarity).”

“We then blend it with urgency + social proof (mutuals going).”

If relevant: show the actual weights currently used (55/25/20).

If fallback occurs: show scoringMethod + fallbackReason.

Implementation details:

Do NOT require clicking; hover should show tooltip.

Keep it subtle (don’t redesign card).

E) Smarter AI “why” line on each event card (context-aware)

Right now the bottom AI line is generic (“Aligns with your vibe”). Fix it so it’s category-aware and feels intelligent.

Rules:

For Campus / Parties / Shows / Misc: vibes/traits language is okay.

For Study: must reference academics/major/year or “focus/structure” traits.

For Deals: must reference urgency + value + friend signal if present.

Examples:

Study group: “Recommended because you score high on Strategy + you listed CSCE/ECEN interest; 2 mutuals are going.”

Deal: “Ending today — high value for your persona + 3 compatible students saved this.”

Party: “High social-energy match + happening this week.”

F) Hover explanation on the AI “why” line (deep dive)

When hovering over the AI “why” line, open a tooltip with 3–4 lines explaining:

Which quiz inputs mattered (major/year + 1–2 trait axes)

Which behavior signals mattered (liked/saved similar events, attended similar category)

Which social signals mattered (mutuals/friends/compatible attendees)

Which time/urgency mattered (today/this week/deadline)

Important: this must be truthful based on available data. If you don’t store some things explicitly, generate a best-effort explanation from what you DO store (traits + interactions + embeddings + RSVPs).

G) Ensure API returns the fields needed (don’t break the existing response shape)

Do NOT break existing fields. Only add.

Events endpoints should include these additional fields per event:

eventCategory (deals/campus/parties/study/shows/misc)

tasteScore, socialScore, urgencyScore, finalScore

matchScore (existing) remains

scoringMethod, fallbackReason (existing)

whyShort (the single-line “AI why” shown on card)

whyLong (3–4 line hover tooltip text)

matchMathTooltip (hover tooltip text for the % badge)

mutualsGoingPreview (names/avatars if available) + mutualsGoingCount

If some fields aren’t available, return empty/null and frontend hides gracefully.

H) UI behavior constraints

Do not change the vertical scroller layout.

Do not add new pages.

Only update Events tab chips behavior, tooltips, and text.

Make sure it works both with demoAuth bypass and normal auth.

I) After implementing

Run:

/api/demo/reset

Open Events tab:

Confirm multi-select works

Confirm Misc shows

Hover works on match badge and AI “why”

Confirm study/deals copy changes are correct
