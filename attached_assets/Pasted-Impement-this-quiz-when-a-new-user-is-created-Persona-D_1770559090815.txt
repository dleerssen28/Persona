Make it look good, follow the current design, and use it to create the persona dna. Make it for each option has two buttons on its edges, the one on the left marks it as least and the right as most. You can only choose one each and you must choose one each. Include a progress bar. Include under the top right a menu that opens a little drop down when clicked. You can either click “Project Details” which shows what the button does now or “Retake Quiz” which retakes quiz and resets persona DNA

ALSO add a all out of matches type of screen when done scrolling through any of the scrolling interfaces. Implement the scrolling to be more like tik tok for example. If you leave the page it should not reshow you all the same ones again. However since there is limited data you can make it looping. But if you scroll one for example and go back you should be on the next one not at the start.
