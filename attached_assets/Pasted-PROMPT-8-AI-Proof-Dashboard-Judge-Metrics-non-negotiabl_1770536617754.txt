PROMPT 8 — “AI Proof Dashboard” + Judge Metrics (non-negotiable)

Goal: Give judges an undeniable screen that shows ML is running and not smoke.

Paste to Replit:
Add a judge-friendly “AI Proof” debug surface (no UI needed, API-only is fine):

Expand GET /api/debug/ai-status to include:

embeddingDim (should be 384)

modelName ("all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via @xenova/transformers")

avgVectorNorm for items + users (sanity check it’s not all zeros)

% of last 20 recommendation items where scoringMethod=embedding (should be ~100%)

for a sample recommendation call: return top 3 items with vectorScore and the top contributing explanation traits

Add GET /api/debug/embedding-similarity-sanity:

randomly pick 5 items from each domain and compute pairwise cosine similarities

return a matrix-like summary (min/mean/max) per domain

Make sure all debug endpoints require auth (fine), but provide a one-liner in docs on how to access.

Do not change UI. Only add these endpoints and logs.

PROMPT 9 — Make Events a “Real-World Compatibility Engine”

Goal: Events should scream interdisciplinary: ML + geospatial + social graph + HCI explainability.

Paste to Replit:
Upgrade events scoring to be a true “experience compatibility predictor”:

Final eventScore = 0.55 tasteEmbeddingSimilarity + 0.25 proximityScore + 0.20 timeRelevance

tasteEmbeddingSimilarity = cosine(userTasteEmbedding, eventEmbedding)

proximityScore = haversine distance buckets (5/15/30/50/100km)

timeRelevance boosts events happening within 14 days; penalize past events

Add GET /api/events/:id/attendee-matches:

for all RSVPed users, compute embedding similarity to requester

return top 10 with: matchPercent, topTraitsWhy (2), and “why we match” sentence

Add GET /api/events/for-you:

returns top events ranked by eventScore

includes: predictedEnjoymentPercent, distanceKm, distanceBucket, nextAction (“RSVP”, “Message 2 top matches”)

Ensure responses include enough fields to demo “this is not Tinder, this predicts real-world fit.”

No UI changes required.

PROMPT 10 — “Cold Start Solved” + “Low Overlap, High Match” Proof

Goal: This is your “holy sh*t” moment: show a high match friend/event even with low explicit overlap.

Paste to Replit:
Implement a novelty-proof demo feature:

Add GET /api/debug/match-proof/:otherUserId that returns:

embeddingMatchPercent

explicitOverlapPercent (based on shared liked/saved items)

showTop3SharedThemes (derived from nearest items in embedding space)

a short explanation: “High match despite low overlap because…”

Ensure at least one seed user pair has:

explicitOverlapPercent < 10%

embeddingMatchPercent > 85%

Add a server seed guarantee: if the condition isn’t met, adjust seed interactions until it is (deterministically).

No UI changes.

PROMPT 11 — Demo Mode: deterministic “1-minute stage script”

Goal: Stop relying on luck. Your demo must always hit.

Paste to Replit:
Create DEMO_MODE endpoints that guarantee a perfect demo in 60 seconds:

Add POST /api/demo/reset:

wipes interactions + RSVPs + tasteEmbeddings

reseeds users, interactions, events, RSVPs

recomputes all embeddings + tasteEmbeddings

guarantees:

1 top recommendation with strong explanation

1 friend match >85% with low overlap proof

1 event ranked #1 with 5+ attendees and attendeeMatches working

Add GET /api/demo/story returning a 6-step demo script with exact pages/endpoints to visit and what you should say.

No UI changes.

PROMPT 12 — JUDGING.md: the “rubric killer” writeup

Goal: Win the paper battle. Make interdisciplinary + AI impossible to deny.

Paste to Replit:
Create JUDGING.md that is short, aggressive, and rubric-aligned:

1 paragraph: what problem we solve (real-world loneliness + wasted time + low-quality social matching)

AI/ML (must include):

transformer embeddings (MiniLM)

vector similarity search (pgvector)

collaborative filtering (“people like you liked”)

hybrid ranking + explainability layer

Interdisciplinary map with headings:

ML/Recsys

Psychology (interpretable axes)

Social computing / network science (compatibility graph, attendee matches)

Geospatial computing (distance-aware event ranking)

HCI / explainable AI (why explanations, trust)

60-second demo script (exact)

Novelty bullets: “why not generic Tinder”
No fluff.
